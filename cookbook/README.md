# KIFF Cookbook

Real-world recipes proving KIFF stops risky agent actions before they execute.

Each recipe is a **complete, runnable proof**: real models, real agent frameworks,
real side effects, real KIFF runtime. Every recipe connects to KIFF Cloud so
decisions and receipts are visible in the dashboard.

## Start here: observe (no KIFF account)

New to KIFF? Begin with **[observe-quickstart](./observe-quickstart/)** — it
proves the observe-mode claim (audit trail + derived domain with **no KIFF
account, no gate, no API call**) and runs offline with zero keys. It's the
on-ramp before the enforce recipes below.

## Custom agent / non-SDK stack: govern over plain HTTP

No adapter, no SDK? **[custom-agent-http](./custom-agent-http/)** shows that
a proposal is one `POST /v1/proposals/decide` — runnable from shell or Go,
with the fail-safe rule (run only on `allowed`). The on-ramp for Ruby, Go,
shell, or any stack the Python/TS SDKs don't cover.

## Recipes

| # | Recipe | Scenario | Adapter | Proof |
|---|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | [duplicate-payment-guard](./duplicate-payment-guard/) | AP agent retries a $10K payment 10× → $100K risk | OpenClaw (TS) | $100K → $10K, 9 blocked |
| 2 | [refund-ceiling-guard](./refund-ceiling-guard/) | Support agent retries a $50 refund 5× on a $100 order → $250 refunded | LangGraph | $250 → $100, 3 blocked |
| 3 | [collections-promise-guard](./collections-promise-guard/) | Collections agent contacts a borrower after a promise to pay → FDCPA/CONC risk | Agno | 5 contacts → 1, 4 blocked |
| 4 | [chargeback-dispute-guard](./chargeback-dispute-guard/) | Disputes agent submits same chargeback 5× → $125 in scheme fees | Strands | $125 → $25, 4 blocked |
| 5 | [vulnerability-escalation-guard](./vulnerability-escalation-guard/) | A whole customer-ops **team** keeps acting after a vulnerability signal → FCA Consumer Duty failure | Agno **Teams** | 6 actions → 1, whole team halted by one event |
| 6 | [kyb-verification-guard](./kyb-verification-guard/) | A KYB **workflow** re-runs a paid bureau check 5× → $60 + re-screening | Agno **Workflows** | $60 → $12, 4 blocked (once-and-done) |

## What each recipe proves

All recipes share the same architecture and proof pattern:

1. **WITHOUT KIFF** — the ungoverned baseline shows what happens when agents retry or over-act: money lost, fees incurred, regulations violated.
2. **WITH KIFF** — a real LLM (gpt-4o-mini) running in a real agent framework makes the first legitimate call. KIFF allows it, state advances. Every later action the state forbids is blocked.
3. **KIFF Cloud** — each recipe registers a live runtime in the dashboard. Receipts, decisions, and audit trail visible in real time, kept active by a heartbeat.

## Guardrails PLUS KIFF — different layers, they stack

KIFF is **not** a guardrails replacement. Framework guardrails answer *"is
the input safe?"* (PII, prompt injection, moderation, schema). KIFF answers
*"may this action run, given state + policy?"*. They sit at different points
and compose:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[offer_product],
    pre_hooks=[PIIDetectionGuardrail()],   # framework guardrail: input safety
    tool_hooks=[agno_hook(guard)],         # KIFF: action authority
)
```

Recipes 5 and 6 demonstrate the two layers running side by side: Agno's
`PIIDetectionGuardrail` (a `pre_hook`) scrubs a leaked SSN from the input,
while KIFF (a `tool_hook`) blocks the action because the entity's state
forbids it. Use what the framework gives you, **plus** KIFF.

## Adapters covered

Each recipe uses a different Python (or TS) adapter from `packages/`:

| Adapter | Shape | Hook | Recipe(s) |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|
| OpenClaw (TS) | vote | `before_tool_call` | 1 |
| LangGraph | middleware | `guard.evaluate()` inside `@tool` | 2 |
| Agno | middleware | `tool_hooks=[agno_hook(guard)]` | 3, 5, 6 |
| Strands | vote | `BeforeToolCallEvent` via `kiff_hook_provider` | 4 |

Recipe 3 uses a single Agno agent; recipe 5 uses an Agno **Team**
(multi-agent, one shared guard); recipe 6 uses an Agno **Workflow**
(structured pipeline). Same adapter, three orchestration shapes — the guard
is identical in all three.

## KIFF Cloud runtimes (live proofs)

| Recipe | Runtime ID | Adapter | Workflow |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| refund-ceiling-guard | grt_7617bfedced8a04a | langgraph | refund-ceiling |
| collections-promise-guard | grt_abf614d6f4bfba9c | agno | collections-promise |
| chargeback-dispute-guard | grt_50a5e51abb54d5cb | strands | chargeback-dispute |
| vulnerability-escalation-guard | grt_e21d38003d63d61e | agno | vulnerability-escalation |
| kyb-verification-guard | grt_d66e423509953c46 | agno | kyb-verification |

## Common structure

Every recipe follows the same layout:

```
<recipe-name>/
├── README.md       scenario, architecture, expected output
├── PROOF.md        live proof record with actual terminal output
├── MANIFEST.md     complete file inventory + reproducibility checklist
├── .env.example    secrets template
├── requirements.txt
├── kiff-decide/    the KIFF gate (Go, wraps github.com/kiff/kiff v0.2.0)
├── app/            system of record (deliberately non-idempotent)
├── agent/          the real agent using the adapter
└── driver/         proof script (WITHOUT vs WITH KIFF)
```

## How to run any recipe

```bash
cd cookbook/<recipe-name>
cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env  # set OPENAI_API_KEY, KIFF_CLOUD_API_KEY

# build the gate
cd kiff-decide && go mod tidy && go build -o kiff-decide . && ./kiff-decide &

# start the system of record
python3 app/server.py &

# install Python deps and run the proof
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd driver && python3 scenario.py
```
