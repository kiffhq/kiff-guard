# Security Policy

## Scope

kiff-guard is a client SDK and collection of framework adapters. Security issues
relevant to this repo include:

- Bypass of the fail-safe: a code path that allows a withheld decision to
  proceed in enforce mode
- Trust-boundary violation: an adapter or core function that injects or forwards
  an authority/roles field to the KIFF API
- Dependency vulnerabilities in the optional adapter extras
- Credential or secret leakage in cookbook recipes or test fixtures

Issues in the KIFF Cloud runtime or the KIFF framework (`kiff/kiff`) should
be reported to those repos respectively.
