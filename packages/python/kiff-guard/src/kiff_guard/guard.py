"""guard — the framework-agnostic core.

`Guard` knows nothing about any agent framework. It exposes three
primitives adapters build on, depending on the framework's control shape:

  observe(tool, args)            — learn + record an "observed" receipt.
                                   No decision, no run. (observe mode)
  decide_only(tool, args)        — learn + call KIFF decide and return the
                                   Decision. Does NOT run the tool and does
                                   NOT record — the adapter records exactly
                                   one receipt via record_executed (allowed)
                                   or record_withheld (withheld). (enforce)
  record_executed / record_withheld — the vote-shape adapter's single
                                   audit write, so one receipt per call.
  evaluate(tool, args, run)      — convenience for middleware frameworks
                                   that let the guard run the tool itself:
                                   observe-and-run, or decide-and-run-or-Hold
                                   (records one receipt internally).

Two adapter shapes use these differently:

  - Middleware / hook frameworks (Agno tool_hooks, Pydantic AI, …) let
    the guard run the tool, so they call `evaluate(tool, args, run=...)`.
  - Inverted-control / approval-native frameworks (Hermes pre_tool_call,
    LangGraph interrupt, OpenAI needs_approval, …) run the tool
    themselves after the hook returns; the hook only votes allow/block.
    They call `observe()` (observe mode) or `decide_only()` (enforce) and
    act on the returned Decision — never the run callback.

observe mode is decide-independent (#244): it works with no client and
no tenant, so a fresh user gets a real audit trail before they have any
KIFF account. The guard logic lives here, once; adapters add none.
