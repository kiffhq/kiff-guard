/**
 * guard — the framework-agnostic core.
 *
 * `Guard` knows nothing about any agent framework. It exposes the
 * primitives adapters build on, depending on the framework's control
 * shape (1:1 port of the Python SDK's guard.py):
 *
 *   observe(tool, args)           — learn + record an "observed" receipt.
 *                                   No decision, no run. (observe mode)
 *   decideOnly(tool, args)        — learn + call KIFF decide and return
 *                                   the Decision. Does NOT run the tool and
 *                                   does NOT record — the adapter records
 *                                   exactly one receipt via recordExecuted
 *                                   (allowed) or recordWithheld (withheld).
 *   recordExecuted / recordWithheld — the vote-shape adapter's single
 *                                   audit write, so one receipt per call.
 *   evaluate(tool, args, run)     — convenience for middleware frameworks
 *                                   that let the guard run the tool.
 *
 * OpenClaw's `before_tool_call` is a vote shape: OpenClaw runs the tool
 * itself; the hook returns a verdict. So its adapter uses observe() /
 * decideOnly() + recordExecuted/recordWithheld, never evaluate(run).
 *
 * observe mode is decide-independent (#244): it works with no client and
 * no tenant, so a fresh user gets a real audit trail before they have any
 * KIFF account. The guard logic lives here, once; adapters add none.
