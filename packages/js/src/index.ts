/**
 * @kiff/kiff-guard — drop-in KIFF clearance for any agent's tool calls.
 *
 * The TypeScript SDK, a faithful port of the Python `kiff_guard` core.
 * Speaks the same versioned decide contract (RFC 017, /v1) and upholds
 * the same invariants (observe is decide-independent and one-receipt;
 * enforce is one governed receipt per call; unknown outcomes fail safe).
 *
 * Quickstart (zero-config audit, no KIFF account needed):
 *
 *     import { Guard } from "@kiff/kiff-guard";
 *     const guard = new Guard({ mode: "observe" });
 *     // attach guard via an adapter (e.g. OpenClaw), run the agent,
 *     // then read guard.receipts and exportYaml("my-domain", guard.catalog).
 *
 * Enforce (once you have a tenant + an active domain):
 *
 *     import { Guard, HTTPClient, ToolMap } from "@kiff/kiff-guard";
 *     const client = new HTTPClient({
 *       apiKey: "kiff_live_...",
 *       toolMap: new ToolMap().bind("refund_order", "REFUND_ORDER", "Order", "order_id"),
 *     });
 *     const guard = new Guard({ client, tenant: "...", agent: "support", mode: "enforce" });
